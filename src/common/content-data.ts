    body: "ChatGPT, has been credited as the author or coauthor of over 200 books on Amazon's bookstore, raising concerns about the potential for a flood of low-quality books. Some of the books are guides to using the chatbot, while others are children's books written by ChatGPT and illustrated by other AI programs. Amazon policies do not require users to disclose the use of AI, so the real number of books authored by ChatGPT could be higher. The trend has been criticized by some, who fear that it could undermine the value of creative writing and put many authors out of work.",

    body: "TikTok creator Michelle Meng, is testing AI-generated recipes against recipes from professional chefs and restaurants on her channel. So far, there has been no clear pattern in the success of either method, although AI seems to do better with more complex ingredients. While some viewers have raised concerns about the ethics of using other creators' recipes in this way, Meng argues that AI is more of a tool than a replacement for human chefs. Although there has been interest in the videos, it remains to be seen whether AI-generated recipes will gain widespread popularity.",

    body: 'ChatGPT has the potential to generate vast amounts of news content. However, the platform has "no commitment to the truth" and has prompted fears it could be used to create fake news stories that appear to have been written by humans, warns journalist Emily Bell. In addition, Bell highlights the ethical issues with OpenAI itself, after it emerged workers in Kenya had been paid less than $2 an hour to sift through graphic content. The hype surrounding ChatGPT has drowned out warnings from experts about the potential risks of the platform, says Bell.',
