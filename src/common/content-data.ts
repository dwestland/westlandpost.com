The layoffs total around a dozen people or about 10% of the public masthead, and are part of a restructuring effort by Red Ventures, the private equity-backed media company that bought CNET in 2020, to focus the site's coverage on areas where it can bring in traffic on Google search. The company will focus on sections it can monetize, including consumer technology, home and wellness, energy, broadband, and personal finance.",

This feature allows ChatGPT to break down complex tasks into smaller steps and add the required items step-by-step, such as building a website or researching itself. The progress report allows the user to see what has been done and what is left to do. AutoGPT is like a team of assistants that asks for permission before each step. Although AutoGPT is slow, expensive, and limited, it has the potential to revolutionize the field.',

    body: '<b style="color: crimson;">VIDEO:</b> Tesla is leveraging AI for practical applications in their self-driving technology. While other companies rely on sensor-based driving, Tesla is transitioning to a vision-based neural network. Their approach replicates human driving by using cameras, AI computers, and labeled video frames as memory. Tesla\'s AI-driven system can recognize objects and navigate the environment based on visual cues. By training the neural network, Tesla can consistently improve its capabilities. This shift toward AI control allows the car to anticipate and plan maneuvers efficiently, mimicking human-like driving behavior. Although challenges remain, AI has the potential to enable driverless Tesla vehicles overnight, showcasing its power and value.',

    body: '<b style="color: crimson;">VIDEO:</b> A recent paper called \'DragYourGAN\' that presents a revolutionary method for interactive image manipulation using AI. It allows users to drag points on an image to manipulate its pose, shape, expression, and layout in real time. The technique works well for characters and other objects, producing realistic outputs even in challenging scenarios. It can be applied to both AI-generated and real images, making it a powerful tool for editing and fine-tuning visuals. The technology is fast, versatile, and offers a quicker and easier alternative to traditional editing methods like Photoshop.',
